#Hostel App#
Applicaton fro small hostel.<br>
I'm using protractor to make tests

###Protractor###
Here you will find install instructions: http://angular.github.io/protractor/

Notice, that in order to make tests protractor need running local server.
In instructions they are using "webdriver-manager start", but we can just run "ionic serve"
